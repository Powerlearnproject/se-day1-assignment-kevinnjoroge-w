2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
.mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
design - building the framework. 
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.


Day 2
Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system designed for tracking file versions and keeping tabs on changes done to projects over time, thereby enabling collaboration and making it facile to make a revision when the need arises. GitHub is a widely used platform that allows for the hosting and management of code on the web, making development progress possible over longer distances too, thus allowing every developer to collaborate easily. Version control assists in maintaining project integrity by tracking changes and resolving errors as they occur while placing responsibility on each developer. Features like branching, merging, and pull requests create collaboration capability and improve code quality.

Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
To create a new repository on GitHub, simply:
Register: Create your GitHub account if you don't already have one.
Click on the "+" symbol: Go to the top right corner of your GitHub screen and click on the "+" option, thereafter click "New repository."
Decide on the repository's type: Choose whether the repository being created shall be private or public.
Specify repository details: Fill in the name and description of the repository, according to whether to initialize the repository with a README file.
Lastly, click Create Repository.
Important decisions made here include whether a repository will be public or private, as well as whether to include that README at that point.


Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
The README document is important in a GitHub repository because it is the communication medium for developers that wish to contribute to project development. A sufficiently robust README file would include:
Project description: Move on and give a brief description of the project.
Instructions for installation: Steps for getting the project up and running.
How to use documentation: Steps on how to really use the project afterwards.
Contribution guidelines: How someone else can contribute.
The README makes it easy to collaborate since it sets the tone for the project. 

4. 
Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
A public repository is more suited for open-source collaboration, visibility, and community contributions. A private repository is meant for a proprietary project. The major advantage of a private repository is that it provides secure options for sensitive projects with controlled user access. On the other was is limited in visibility and collaboration. Accordingly, public repositories provide a good platform for an open-source project, while private repositories suit better proprietary or sensitive projects.

5. 
Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
Create a Local Repository: Use git init to initialize a Git repository in your modem on your local machine.
Add Files: Use git add to stage your files.
Commit: Use git commit -m "First commit" to commit your files with a meaningful commit message.
"Commits are basically snapshots of changes made to your project." They help one track changes and manage different versions by providing a history of changes made.

  6.
How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branches allow multiple versions of the same project to be created simultaneously. Here is how it works :
Create Branch: Use git branch to create a new branch.
Switch Branch: Use git checkout to switch to the new branch.
Merge Branch: Once finished with changes, the branch gets merged back into the main branch using git merge.
Branching is important in collaborative development because it allows members to work on different features without stepping on each other's work.

7. Discuss the working of pull requests in a GitHub workflow. How does it provide for peer reviews and collaborative input, and what are some steps that are taken in creating and merging a pull request?
Answer: The Pull Requests are basically a proposal made by developers to a repository related to changes or modifications. Steps include:

Create a Branch: Make changes in another branch.
Push Changes: Push the branch to GitHub.
Make Pull Request: Proposal to make changes to the master branch with the help of a Pull Request.
Review and Merging: After examination by team members, upon approval by the team, the changes are merged.
Pull requests provide a check on the changes before they are added to the main project, hence improving code quality and collaborative communication.


8. Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
 Forking creates a repository copy in your account, enabling you to make changes independently. The big difference between forking and cloning is that cloning creates a local copy of a repository, while forking creates a remote copy. Forking is useful when you want to contribute to somebody else's project but do not have direct push access to that project.

9.Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
Issues are used to track bugs, feature requests, or tasks. The Project Boards organizes issues into boards to visualize project progress. These tools help collaboration by allowing management in a structured fashion, in terms of tracking issue progress.

10. Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration? Common problems include merging conflicts and understanding Git commands. Best practices include:
Writing Meaningful Commit Messages: Clearly state what changes were made in the commit.
Regular Updates to Local Repository: Use git pull regularly to be up-to-date with the remote changes.
Branching: Do not edit anything in the main branch directly; instead use branches for this purpose.
